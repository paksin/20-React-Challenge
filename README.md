## Description

Welcome to my portfolio, where you could discover more about myself as a Full-Stack Developer! Created using React and Bootstrap, the website features Personal and Collaborated Projects, an About Me page, a Contact form with validation, and my Resume. Furthermore, the page implemented responsive design concepts with a minimalistic approach, ensuring a butter-smooth experience from mobile to PC.
